### Added

#### Phase 1 — Core Engine + CLI Proxy
- Rust workspace with 4 crates: `sqz_engine`, `sqz`, `sqz-mcp`, `sqz-wasm`
- Core data model types and enums (`Content`, `Session`, `Preset` with `PresetHeader`, `CacheResult`, etc.; `SessionState` / `PresetMeta` kept as compatibility aliases)
- TOON encoder/decoder — lossless JSON compression with ASCII-safe output
- 8-stage compression pipeline (keep_fields, strip_fields, condense, strip_nulls, flatten, truncate_strings, collapse_arrays, custom_transforms)
- TOML preset parser with validation and hot-reload
- SQLite FTS5 session store with full-text search
- SHA-256 file cache with LRU eviction and cross-session persistence
- Immutable correction log with compaction protection
- Cost calculator with per-tool USD breakdown and cache discount awareness
- Budget tracker with multi-agent support and predictive warnings
- Pin/unpin content protection from compaction
- Tree-sitter AST parser for 18 programming languages
- Prompt cache detector for Anthropic (90%) and OpenAI (50%) boundaries
- Model router with complexity-based local/remote routing
- Terse mode system prompt injection (3 levels)
- CTX format serializer/deserializer for cross-model session portability
- Plugin API (Rust trait + WASM interface) with priority-ordered pipeline insertion
- SqzEngine facade wiring all modules together
- CLI binary with shell hooks (Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell)
- CLI commands: init, compress, export, import, status, cost
- 100+ CLI compression patterns
- Cross-compilation configs for 5 platforms (Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS x86_64/aarch64, Windows x86_64)
- Distribution: cargo, brew, npm, pip, curl script, Docker, GitHub Releases

#### Phase 2 — MCP Server
- MCP server with stdio and SSE transports
- Tool selector with Jaccard similarity matching
- Preset hot-reload via file watcher (<2s)
- JSON-RPC 2.0 handler (initialize, tools/list, tools/call)
- Platform integration configs for 15 Level 1 + Level 2 platforms
- npm and pip distribution wrappers
- Homebrew formula

#### Phase 3 — Browser Extension (WASM)
- WASM build target with self-contained TOON encoder
- Chrome extension manifest v3
- Content scripts for 5 web UIs (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity)
- Compression preview banner for content > 500 tokens
- Settings popup with stats display

#### Phase 4 — IDE Native Extensions
- VS Code extension with CLI bridge, status bar widget, 7 commands
- JetBrains plugin with CLI bridge, status bar widget, 5 actions
- Image-to-semantic-description compression (95%+ reduction)
- Level 3 platform publishing guides (VS Code Marketplace, JetBrains Marketplace, Chrome Web Store, API proxy)

#### Testing
- 753 tests across all crates
- 81 property-based correctness properties via proptest
- Property tests cover: TOON round-trip, token reduction, ASCII safety, cache dedup/invalidation/LRU/persistence, budget invariants, pin round-trips, CTX round-trip, preset round-trip, plugin priority, tool selection cardinality, model routing, terse mode injection, prompt cache preservation, cross-tokenizer determinism, and more
